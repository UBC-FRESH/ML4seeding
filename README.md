# ML4seeding

This project aims to identify suitable **microsites** for reforestration after disturbances such as cuttingh and/or fire. To acheive this goal aerial images are analyzed using machine learning alogrithms.

## Project Motivation
Following disturbances, reforestation is constrained by limited field access and the cost of manual site assessment and seeding.  
This project trains a **U-Net based semantic segmentation** model to high-resolution images to automatically locate **appropriate microsites** to guide aerial seeding missions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Prepare and preprocess images for model training.
- Train and evaluate U-Net segmentation models for microsite detection.
- Generate georeferenced prediction layers for operational field planning.
- Track model improvements and document methodological decisions.
