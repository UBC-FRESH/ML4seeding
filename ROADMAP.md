# 🗺️ Roadmap 
  📍 Training on approapriate ML algorithms
  📍 Getting high quality images
  📍 Labelling images to identify qualities of microsites for the traing dataset
  📍 Building the pipeline of the suggested architechture
  📍 Training the model on the training dataset
  📍 Fine tuning the model to improve accuracy
  📍 Applying the model to test set
  📍 Improving the model to address potential overfitting
